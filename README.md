    The prototype styling depends on SemanticUI. This can be installed by installing node.js and and gulp and running the following commands:

    $ npm install
    $ cd semantic && gulp build

    The all the prototype functionality will work without the styling, but the prototype relies on HTML5 canvas for its animations, which requires that your browser supports the HTML5 canvas.
