The prototype styling depends on SemanticUI. This can be installed by installing node.js and and gulp and running the following commands:

    $ npm install
    $ cd semantic && gulp build

All the prototype functionality will work without the syling, but the prototype relies on HTML5 canvas for its animations, which requires that your browser supports the HTML5 canvas.
